Repository for the manuscript entitled "Developing Capabilities for Supply Chain Resilience in a Post-COVID World: A Machine Learning based Thematic Analysis".



## Abstract

This study examines the past, present, and future of supply chain resilience (SCR) research in the context of COVID-19. Specifically, a total of 1,717 papers in the SCR field are classified into eleven thematic clusters, which are subsequently verified by a supervised machine learning approach. Each cluster is then analyzed within the context of COVID-19, leading to the identification of three associated capabilities (i.e., interconnectedness, transformability, and sharing) that firms should focus on to build a more resilient supply chain in the post-COVID world. The derived insights offer invaluable guidance not only for practicing managers, but also for scholars as they design their future research projects related to SCR for greatest impact.
